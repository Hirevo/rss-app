RSS App (macOS)
=============

About
-----

This is the macOS app for **`RSS App`**, allowing the use of the service on any machine running macOS, like MacBooks and iMacs.

The app is written in [**Swift**](https://swift.org), using the [**SwiftUI toolkit**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/).  
It communicates with the server to render its data.

Build and Run
-------------

To compile the app, you'll need to have XCode 12 (or higher) installed on your machine (which may require one who is running macOS).

Once you have Rust installed, simply open **`RSS App.xcodeproj`** file within XCode, and you'll be all set to start a build.

First, choose your destination in `Product > Destination > Choose Destination` from the menu bar.

To build, then click on `Product > Build` from the menu bar.  
To run, click on `Product > Run` instead.
